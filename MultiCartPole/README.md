## A multi cart gym environment 

Basically took the single cart environment from the Gym website and
made it into a Factored RL problem

To run:
```
cd MultiCartPole/
pip install -e .
cd ..
python main.py
```

### Future Work

I'm looking into coupled and more complex multi cartpole systems so I can understand the robustness of current Factored RL algorithms.
